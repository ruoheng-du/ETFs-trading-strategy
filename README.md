# Development and Evaluation of a Long-only Day Trading Strategy for ETFs | Fall 2024
This is the repository for the ETF Day Trading Strategy Development project done in Finance and Structuring for Data Science course during Fall 2024. The project focuses on designing and evaluating a long-only day trading strategy for the NYSEARCA: GDX ETF using machine learning models. The aim of the project was to leverage data-driven insights to optimize trading decisions and enhance profitability in a volatile market environment. The project involves the development of predictive models to generate buy signals for ETF trading. It evaluates various machine learning models and explores strategies that include dynamic stop-loss and take-profit conditions. The primary contributions of the project are:

- Data preprocessing and analysis: Standardizing and preparing daily price data for modeling.
- Buy signal generation strategies: Implementing three unique strategies to identify optimal trading opportunities.
- Model implementation and evaluation: Testing Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with hyperparameter tuning to maximize performance.
- Ensemble modeling: Combining outputs from individual models for improved profitability. Achieved 17% higher profitability compared to the best individual model.
